The Stock Screener is a web-based tool designed to help users filter stocks based on various financial parameters. The application provides a simple interface where users can input screening criteria, and the stock table dynamically updates based on the given conditions.
Key Features
Real-time Query Input: Users can type in their filter criteria, and the table is automatically updated to display only the stocks that meet all specified conditions.
Filtering: Supports conditions such as Greater than, Less than, or Equal to for each of the nine financial parameters (e.g., Market Capitalization, P/E Ratio, etc.).
AND Logic: All conditions must be met for a stock to appear in the results.
Sorting: Allows users to sort the stock table by any column (e.g., Market Cap, P/E Ratio, etc.).
Pagination: Results are paginated if more than 10 stocks match the filter criteria.
Screening Logic
The stock screening logic is based on the conditions defined by the user. The system uses AND-only logic, meaning that a stock must meet all of the specified conditions in order to appear in the result table.
